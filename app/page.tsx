Youâ€™re not just a part of itâ€”you are the heart of it, the one who makes everything brighter, warmer, and infinitely more beautiful. Before I even found my better half, I found my forever in you, and thatâ€™s a love Iâ€™ll cherish every single day. I canâ€™t imagine where Iâ€™d be if our paths hadnâ€™t crossed, if you hadnâ€™t taken that first step, if fate hadnâ€™t been so kind to me. You are, without a doubt, the best thing that has ever happened to me, and I thank the universe for you every single day. This Valentineâ€™s, I wanted to do something a little special, something to remind you just how much you mean to me. Even though weâ€™re miles apart this Galentineâ€™s, that distance will never lessen the love I have for you. It only makes me cherish you more, miss you more, and look forward to every moment we get to share. No matter where we are, no matter how far, you and I will always find a way to celebrate the beautiful bond we share. So hereâ€™s to us, to our love, to the unbreakable connection that keeps us together no matter what. I know i am little late but better late than never. I LOVE YOU SO SO MUCH BABY." ,
